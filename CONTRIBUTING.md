# Contributing to Musical Chairs

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Musical Chairs project! We are building this game with our community, and every contribution, no matter how small, is highly valued.

This document provides guidelines for how you can get involved.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to the project's success. Here are some of the most impactful ones:

### üéÆ Play the Game & Provide Feedback

The most important contribution you can make is to play the game and share your experience with us.

- **Join Playtests:** Participate in our community playtest sessions announced in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wnnJKjgfZW).
- **Report Bugs:** If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/crow-004/musical-chairs-game/issues) on this repository. Follow the bug report template to provide as much detail as possible.
- **Suggest Features:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement? Open an issue and let's discuss it!

### üêõ Report Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** report it in a public issue. Refer to our [**Security Policy (SECURITY.md)**](SECURITY.md) for instructions on how to report it privately.

### üìà Help Grow the Community

- **Be Active:** Participate in discussions in our Discord and Telegram channels.
- **Invite Friends:** Use your referral link (available on the game page) to invite others to play.
- **Create Content:** Write articles, create videos, or make memes about the game. Share them with us in Discord! High-quality content is rewarded through our [Contribution Points System](CONTRIBUTION_SYSTEM.md).

### üíª Code Contributions

Our smart contracts are fully open-source. If you are a Solidity developer and wish to contribute, please follow this process:

1.  **Fork the [contracts repository](https://github.com/crow-004/musical-chairs-contracts).**
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  Write your code and, most importantly, **add tests** to cover your changes.
4.  Ensure all existing tests pass.
5.  Open a Pull Request with a clear description of the changes you've made.

*Please note: The backend and frontend source code are currently proprietary to protect our unique implementation and business logic during this early stage. We believe this hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: on-chain trust and off-chain competitive advantage.*

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to a high standard of communication. Be respectful, constructive, and open to feedback. Harassment or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.
