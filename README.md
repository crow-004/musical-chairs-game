# Musical Chairs on Web3

![Game Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crow-004/musical-chairs-game/main/docs/images/banner.png)

A real-time multiplayer musical chairs game on the blockchain, built with Go and Web3 technologies. This project is a showcase of a full-stack application featuring a Go backend, smart contracts on Ethereum, and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

This repository serves as the main hub for the Musical Chairs project, including documentation, feedback, and bug reports.

## üõ°Ô∏è Open Source Commitment

In the spirit of Web3, we believe that trust is paramount. To ensure full transparency and allow our community to verify our code, we have open-sourced all smart contracts governing the game.

-   **Smart Contract Repository:** [**github.com/crow-004/musical-chairs-contracts**](https://github.com/crow-004/musical-chairs-contracts)

While the smart contracts are public, the backend and frontend source code remains proprietary for now to protect our unique implementation and business logic. We believe this hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: on-chain trust and off-chain competitive advantage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, containerized architecture to ensure reliability and scalability.

- **Backend:** Written in **Go**, handling all real-time game logic, user sessions, and WebSocket communication. The source code is currently proprietary.
- **Smart Contracts:** **Solidity** contracts, deployed on an Ethereum-compatible network, manage the core game rules and funds. The contracts are **open-source (MIT License)** and have been verified on-chain. You can review the code in our [contracts repository](https://github.com/crow-004/musical-chairs-contracts).
- **Frontend:** Built with vanilla **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** for a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Infrastructure:** The entire application is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**, running behind an **Nginx** reverse proxy for security and performance.
- **Code Quality:** **SonarQube** is used for continuous static code analysis to maintain high code quality.
