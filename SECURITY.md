# Security Policy

The Musical Chairs team takes the security of our game and smart contracts seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community to help keep our project safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, Discord, or other public channels.**

Instead, please report them to our dedicated security email address: **crow004@protonmail.com**.

If possible, encrypt your message with a PGP key if you have one.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to include in your report

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

*   **Type of issue** (e.g., smart contract vulnerability, re-entrancy, front-end exploit, etc.)
*   **Location of the vulnerability** (e.g., which contract, which function, which line of code).
*   **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue.
*   **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible).
*   **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it.

## Disclosure Policy

*   We will make our best effort to respond to your report promptly, acknowledging receipt.
*   We will keep you informed as we work to validate and fix the vulnerability.
*   We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability to others until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.

## Bug Bounties

We do not have a formal, public bug bounty program at this time. However, we highly value the contributions of security researchers.

**Rewards for valid and previously unreported vulnerabilities are awarded at our sole discretion.** The amount will be based on the severity, impact, and quality of the report. Please note that a report does not guarantee a reward.

Thank you for helping keep Musical Chairs secure!
